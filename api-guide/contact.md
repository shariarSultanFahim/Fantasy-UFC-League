## Data Types
 
```typescript
export interface IContactPayload {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  subject: string;
  message: string;

}
```

## Frontend Integration Tips
 
- **Validation**: Ensure that all fields are filled and the email format is valid before sending the request.
- **Feedback**: Show a success toast or message after the response is received to let the user know their message is on its way.
- **Loading State**: Disable the "Submit" button while the request is in progress to prevent multiple submissions.
